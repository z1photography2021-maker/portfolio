## 🎯 Your Photo Specifications:
- **Source**: `/public/auto-parts-professional.png`
- **Quality**: Excellent professional headshot ✅
- **Background**: Clean gray background ✅  
- **Pose**: Professional arms-crossed business pose ✅
- **Attire**: Dark business suit with striped tie ✅
- **Resolution**: High quality, suitable for web ✅

## 📁 File Cleanup Needed:
I noticed you have both:
- ✅ `/public/auto-parts-professional.png` (correct)
- ❌ `/public/auto-parts-professional_png.tsx` (should be deleted)

The `.tsx` file is unnecessary and should be removed. Only the `.png` file is needed.

## 🚀 Deployment Steps:

### Step 1: Clean Up Files (Optional)
```bash
# Remove the unnecessary .tsx file
rm public/auto-parts-professional_png.tsx
```

### Step 2: Deploy Updated Code
```bash
# Commit your changes
git add .
git commit -m "Update portfolio with personal professional photo"
git push origin main
```

### Step 3: Verify Deployment
1. Wait 2-3 minutes for Netlify auto-deployment
2. Visit: https://amitavburman.com
3. Check that your photo appears in:
   - ✅ Hero section (large circular photo)
   - ✅ About section (smaller square photo)
