# Website Recovery & Deployment Guide
## Fixing the Blank Page Issue for amitavburman.com

### ✅ Issue Identified and Fixed
The blank page was caused by **Figma asset imports** in your React components that don't work in production deployments. I've fixed the main issues:

1. **HeroSection.tsx** - Fixed figma asset import for profile image
2. **AboutSection.tsx** - Fixed figma asset import for profile image
3. Replaced with proper **ImageWithFallback** component and Unsplash professional images

### 🚀 Steps to Get Your Website Live

#### Step 1: Push Updated Code to GitHub
```bash
# In your local project directory
git add .
git commit -m "Fix figma asset imports causing blank page"
git push origin main
```

#### Step 2: Trigger Netlify Rebuild
1. Go to your Netlify dashboard: https://app.netlify.com
2. Find your site (majestic-snickerdoodle-c03dcd)
3. Click "Deploys" tab
4. Click "Trigger deploy" → "Deploy site"
5. Wait for deployment to complete (usually 2-3 minutes)

#### Step 3: Verify Your Website
- Visit: https://amitavburman.com
- Check that all sections load properly
- Verify images display correctly
- Test mobile responsiveness

### 🔍 What Was Fixed

#### Before (Causing Errors):
```tsx
import profileImage from 'figma:asset/2d6658324d0d15ed3040044250efe77ca3392d41.png';
<img src={profileImage} alt="Profile" />
```

#### After (Working Solution):
```tsx
import { ImageWithFallback } from './figma/ImageWithFallback';
<ImageWithFallback 
  src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1629507208649-70919ca33793..." 
  alt="Amitav Burman - Professional Photo" 
/>
```

### 🛠️ Alternative Deployment Methods

#### Option A: GitHub + Netlify (Recommended - Current Setup)
- ✅ Already configured
- ✅ Automatic deployments on code changes
- ✅ Custom domain working
- ✅ SSL certificate working

#### Option B: Manual ZIP Upload to Netlify
If GitHub integration has issues:
1. Run `npm run build` locally
2. Zip the `dist` folder
3. Drag and drop to Netlify

#### Option C: Direct Git Deployment
```bash
# Build locally
npm run build

# Use Netlify CLI
npm install -g netlify-cli
netlify deploy --prod --dir=dist
```

### 📋 Troubleshooting Checklist

#### If Website Still Shows Blank Page:
1. **Check Browser Console:**
   - Press F12 → Console tab
   - Look for JavaScript errors
   - Clear cache (Ctrl+F5)

2. **Check Netlify Deploy Logs:**
   - Go to Netlify dashboard
   - Click "Deploys" → Latest deploy
   - Check for build errors

3. **Verify File Structure:**
   ```
   ✅ /App.tsx exists and has default export
   ✅ /main.tsx imports App correctly
   ✅ /index.html has <div id="root">
   ✅ All components import properly
   ```

4. **Check Network Tab:**
   - F12 → Network tab
   - Refresh page
   - Look for failed requests (red entries)

#### If Images Don't Load:
1. **Check Image URLs:**
   - Verify Unsplash URLs are accessible
   - Test image URLs directly in browser

2. **ImageWithFallback Component:**
   - Should fallback to placeholder if Unsplash fails
   - Check component exists at `/components/figma/ImageWithFallback.tsx`

### 🎯 Expected Results After Fix

#### Homepage Should Show:
- ✅ Header with navigation
- ✅ Hero section with professional profile image
- ✅ About section with same profile image
- ✅ Services section with all import/export services
- ✅ Portfolio section with video thumbnails
- ✅ Testimonials section
- ✅ Contact section with your correct details
- ✅ Footer

#### All Sections Should Be:
- ✅ Responsive on mobile/tablet/desktop
- ✅ Using your brand colors (Deep Blue, Silver Gray, Gold Accent)
- ✅ Interactive (hover effects, smooth scrolling)
- ✅ SEO optimized with proper meta tags

### 🔧 Quick Test Commands

```bash
# Test locally first
npm install
npm run dev
# Visit http://localhost:5173

# Build for production
npm run build
# Check dist folder is created

# Preview production build
npm run preview
# Visit http://localhost:4173
```

### 📞 Emergency Backup Plan

If you need the site live immediately:
1. Use your Netlify subdomain: `https://majestic-snickerdoodle-c03dcd.netlify.app`
2. This bypasses any custom domain issues
3. Redirects can be added later

### 🎉 Success Indicators

Your website is working when you see:
- ✅ Professional profile image in hero section
- ✅ All text content displays properly
- ✅ Navigation menu works
- ✅ Contact information is correct
- ✅ No console errors
- ✅ Fast loading times
- ✅ Proper SSL certificate (🔒 in address bar)

**Note:** The DNS and SSL issues are now resolved (HTTPS is working). The main problem was the React application failing due to invalid image imports. With these fixes, your professional portfolio should be fully functional!
