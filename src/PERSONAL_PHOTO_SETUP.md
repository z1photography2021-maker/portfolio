## Adding Your Photo to amitavburman.com

### 📸 Step 1: Prepare Your Photo

#### Photo Requirements:

### 📁 Step 2: Add Photo to Project

1. **Save your photo as**: `amitav-burman-photo.jpg` (or `.png`)
2. **Upload to**: `/public/` folder in your project
3. **File path should be**: `/public/amitav-burman-photo.jpg`

### 🔧 Step 3: File Structure After Adding Photo
```
/public/
├── favicon.svg
├── auto-parts-professional.png
└── amitav-burman-photo.jpg  ← Your new photo here
```

### 💻 Step 4: Update Components

After adding your photo to the public folder, I'll update the components to use it. The photo will be accessible at `/amitav-burman-photo.jpg` in the browser.

### ⚡ Step 5: Alternative Upload Methods

#### Option A: Direct Upload to Public Folder
1. In your code editor/IDE, navigate to `/public/` folder
2. Drag and drop your photo file
3. Rename to `amitav-burman-photo.jpg`

#### Option B: Via Netlify File Upload
1. Build your site locally with the new photo
2. Deploy the updated version

#### Option C: Use External URL
If you have your photo hosted elsewhere (LinkedIn, Google Drive, etc.):
1. Get the direct image URL
2. I can update the components to use that URL

### 🎯 Expected Results

After adding your photo and updating the components:
- ✅ Hero section will show your professional photo
- ✅ About section will use the same photo (smaller version)
- ✅ Consistent branding across the site
- ✅ Fast loading with proper optimization
- ✅ Responsive display on all devices

### 📱 Photo Optimization Tips

#### For Best Performance:
```bash
# If you have access to image editing tools:
# - Resize to exactly 800x800px for about section
# - Resize to exactly 1000x1000px for hero section
# - Compress to 85-90% quality
# - Save as JPG with progressive encoding
```

### 🔄 Backup Plan

If you don't have a professional photo ready:
1. **Temporary**: Keep current Unsplash placeholder
2. **Quick Solution**: Use LinkedIn profile photo
3. **Professional**: Schedule a professional headshot session
4. **DIY**: Take a high-quality photo with good lighting and solid background

**Next Step**: Once you add your photo file to the `/public/` folder, let me know and I'll update the HeroSection and AboutSection components to use your personal photo instead of the placeholder!
