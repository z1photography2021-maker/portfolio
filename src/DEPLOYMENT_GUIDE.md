# Portfolio Website Deployment Guide

## Overview
This guide will help you deploy your portfolio website to Netlify using GitHub integration. Your site will be live at http://amitavburman.com after deployment.

## Prerequisites
- [x] GitHub account
- [x] Netlify account
- [x] Domain (amitavburman.com) - already purchased through GoDaddy
- [x] Project code ready for deployment

## Step 1: Prepare Your Code for Deployment

### 1.1 Verify Build Configuration
Your project is already configured with Vite. Ensure your `package.json` has the correct build scripts:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "vite",
    "build": "tsc && vite build",
    "preview": "vite preview"
  }
}
```

### 1.2 Check Netlify Configuration
Your `netlify.toml` file should contain:

```toml
[build]
  publish = "dist"
  command = "npm run build"

[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/index.html"
  status = 200
```

### 1.3 Environment Variables (if needed)
If you're using any environment variables, create a `.env.example` file to document them:

```bash
# Add any environment variables here
# VITE_API_URL=your_api_url
```

## Step 2: Push Code to GitHub

### 2.1 Initialize Git Repository (if not already done)
```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: Complete portfolio website with client testimonials"
```

### 2.2 Create GitHub Repository
1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com)
2. Click "+" in the top right corner
3. Select "New repository"
4. Name it `amitav-portfolio` or `portfolio-website`
5. Keep it public (or private if you prefer)
6. Don't initialize with README (since you already have code)
7. Click "Create repository"

### 2.3 Connect Local Repository to GitHub
```bash
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME.git
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 3: Deploy to Netlify

### 3.1 Connect GitHub to Netlify
1. Log in to [Netlify](https://netlify.com)
2. Click "Add new site" â†’ "Import an existing project"
3. Choose "Deploy with GitHub"
4. Authorize Netlify to access your GitHub account
5. Select your portfolio repository

### 3.2 Configure Build Settings
Netlify should auto-detect your settings, but verify:
- **Base directory**: Leave empty (root)
- **Build command**: `npm run build`
- **Publish directory**: `dist`
- **Node version**: 18 or later (recommended)

### 3.3 Deploy the Site
1. Click "Deploy site"
2. Wait for the build to complete (usually 2-3 minutes)
3. Your site will be live at a random Netlify URL (e.g., `amazing-curie-123456.netlify.app`)

## Step 4: Configure Custom Domain

### 4.1 Add Custom Domain in Netlify
1. In your Netlify site dashboard, go to "Site settings"
2. Click "Domain management"
3. Click "Add custom domain"
4. Enter `amitavburman.com`
5. Click "Verify" and "Add domain"

### 4.2 Configure DNS at GoDaddy
1. Log in to your GoDaddy account
2. Go to "My Products" â†’ "Domains" â†’ Manage `amitavburman.com`
3. Go to "DNS" â†’ "Manage Zones"
4. Update the following records:

**Delete existing A records and add:**
```
Type: A
Name: @
Value: 75.2.60.5
TTL: 600 seconds
```

**Add CNAME record:**
```
Type: CNAME
Name: www
Value: YOUR_NETLIFY_SITE_NAME.netlify.app
TTL: 1 Hour
```

### 4.3 Enable HTTPS
1. In Netlify, go to "Site settings" â†’ "Domain management"
2. Click "Verify DNS configuration"
3. Once verified, click "Provision certificate" under HTTPS
4. Wait for SSL certificate to be issued (can take up to 24 hours)

## Step 5: Set Up Continuous Deployment

### 5.1 Automatic Deployments
Your site is now set up for continuous deployment. Every time you push to the `main` branch, Netlify will automatically rebuild and deploy your site.

### 5.2 Deploy Previews
Netlify will also create deploy previews for pull requests, allowing you to test changes before merging.

## Step 6: Optimize for Production

### 6.1 Add Performance Headers
Update your `netlify.toml` to include performance optimizations:

```toml
[build]
  publish = "dist"
  command = "npm run build"

[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/index.html"
  status = 200

[[headers]]
  for = "/*"
  [headers.values]
    X-Frame-Options = "DENY"
    X-XSS-Protection = "1; mode=block"
    X-Content-Type-Options = "nosniff"
    Referrer-Policy = "strict-origin-when-cross-origin"

[[headers]]
  for = "/assets/*"
  [headers.values]
    Cache-Control = "public, max-age=31536000, immutable"
```

### 6.2 Enable Form Handling (for Contact Form)
If your contact form isn't working, add this to your contact form:
```html
<form name="contact" method="POST" data-netlify="true">
  <input type="hidden" name="form-name" value="contact" />
  <!-- your form fields -->
</form>
```

## Step 7: Verify Deployment

### 7.1 Check Your Live Site
1. Visit `https://amitavburman.com`
2. Test all sections:
   - [x] Hero section with your photo
   - [x] About section
   - [x] Services section
   - [x] Portfolio section
   - [x] Testimonials (Mithun Ghosh and EK Piseth)
   - [x] Contact section
   - [x] Footer

### 7.2 Test Performance
1. Use [Google PageSpeed Insights](https://pagespeed.web.dev/)
2. Test your site URL
3. Optimize any issues found

### 7.3 Test Mobile Responsiveness
1. Test on various devices and screen sizes
2. Use browser dev tools to simulate different devices

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Build Failures
- Check build logs in Netlify dashboard
- Ensure all dependencies are in `package.json`
- Verify Node.js version compatibility

### Image Loading Issues
- Ensure all Figma assets are properly imported
- Check image file paths
- Verify fallback images are accessible

### DNS Issues
- DNS changes can take 24-48 hours to propagate
- Use [DNS Checker](https://dnschecker.org/) to verify propagation
- Clear browser cache and DNS cache

## Quick Deployment Commands

```bash
# Make changes to your code
git add .
git commit -m "Update: Description of your changes"
git push origin main

# Your site will automatically deploy in 2-3 minutes
```
