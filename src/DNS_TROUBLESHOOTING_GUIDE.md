# DNS Configuration & SSL Certificate Troubleshooting Guide
## For amitavburman.com on Netlify

### Current Status Analysis
Based on your Netlify dashboard, I can see:
- ✅ DNS records are configured in Netlify
- ✅ Domain is connected to Netlify (majestic-snickerdoodle-c03dcd.netlify.app)
- ❌ SSL certificate stuck in "Waiting on DNS propagation" for 24+ hours
- ⚠️ Nameservers showing: dns1.p08.nsone.net, dns2.p08.nsone.net

### Root Cause Analysis
The 24+ hour delay in DNS propagation is abnormal and indicates one of these issues:

1. **Nameserver Mismatch**: Your GoDaddy domain may not be using Netlify's nameservers
2. **DNS Record Conflicts**: Existing DNS records in GoDaddy are conflicting
3. **Propagation Delays**: Some DNS servers haven't updated yet
4. **DNSSEC Issues**: DNSSEC might be enabled and causing conflicts

### Step-by-Step Resolution

#### Step 1: Verify Nameserver Configuration in GoDaddy
1. Log into your GoDaddy account
2. Go to "My Products" → "Domains" → "amitavburman.com"
3. Click "Manage DNS" or "DNS Settings"
4. Check if nameservers are set to:
   - `dns1.p08.nsone.net`
   - `dns2.p08.nsone.net`

**If nameservers are different:**
- Change them to the ones shown in your Netlify dashboard
- Wait 24-48 hours for propagation

#### Step 2: Check for Conflicting DNS Records in GoDaddy
If using GoDaddy's DNS management instead of Netlify's nameservers:
1. Remove any existing A, AAAA, or CNAME records for:
   - `@` (root domain)
   - `www`
2. Add these records in GoDaddy DNS:
   ```
   Type: CNAME
   Name: www
   Value: majestic-snickerdoodle-c03dcd.netlify.app
   
   Type: A
   Name: @
   Value: 75.2.60.5 (Netlify's IP)
   ```

#### Step 3: Disable DNSSEC (if enabled)
1. In GoDaddy domain settings, look for "DNSSEC" settings
2. If enabled, disable it temporarily
3. Wait 24 hours for changes to propagate

#### Step 4: Force SSL Certificate Renewal in Netlify
1. Go to your Netlify site dashboard
2. Navigate to "Domain management" → "HTTPS"
3. Click "Renew certificate" or "Provision certificate"
4. If that fails, try "Force HTTPS" toggle off, then on again

#### Step 5: Alternative DNS Management Approach
**Option A: Use Netlify DNS (Recommended)**
1. In your Netlify site, go to "Domain management"
2. Note the nameservers provided by Netlify
3. Update your GoDaddy domain to use these nameservers
4. Remove all DNS records from GoDaddy (Netlify will handle everything)

**Option B: Use GoDaddy DNS**
1. Keep GoDaddy nameservers
2. In GoDaddy DNS, set up:
   - A record: `@` → `75.2.60.5`
   - CNAME record: `www` → `majestic-snickerdoodle-c03dcd.netlify.app`
3. In Netlify, ensure "Use Netlify DNS" is disabled

### Verification Steps

#### Check DNS Propagation
Use these tools to verify DNS propagation:
- https://dnschecker.org
- https://www.whatsmydns.net
- Command line: `nslookup amitavburman.com`

#### Expected Results:
```
amitavburman.com should point to: 75.2.60.5
www.amitavburman.com should point to: majestic-snickerdoodle-c03dcd.netlify.app
```

#### Test SSL Certificate
- Try accessing: https://amitavburman.com
- Try accessing: https://www.amitavburman.com
- Both should work without security warnings

### Quick Diagnostic Commands

Run these in your terminal to check current DNS status:

```bash
# Check current nameservers
dig NS amitavburman.com

# Check A record
dig A amitavburman.com

# Check CNAME record for www
dig CNAME www.amitavburman.com

# Check from different DNS servers
dig @8.8.8.8 amitavburman.com
dig @1.1.1.1 amitavburman.com
```

### Timeline Expectations

- **Nameserver changes**: 24-48 hours
- **DNS record changes**: 5 minutes to 24 hours
- **SSL certificate provisioning**: 5-60 minutes after DNS resolves
- **Full propagation worldwide**: Up to 72 hours

### If Problems Persist

1. **Contact Netlify Support**: Provide your site ID and explain the SSL issue
2. **Contact GoDaddy Support**: Ask them to verify DNS configuration
3. **Try CloudFlare**: As an intermediate DNS service for faster propagation

### Alternative Temporary Solution

While waiting for DNS to resolve:
1. You can access your site at: `https://majestic-snickerdoodle-c03dcd.netlify.app`
2. This bypasses the custom domain DNS issues
3. Your site is fully functional, just not on your custom domain yet

### Most Likely Fix

Based on the 24+ hour delay, the most probable solution is:
1. Log into GoDaddy
2. Change nameservers to exactly match what Netlify shows
3. Wait 24-48 hours
4. SSL certificate should provision automatically

### Prevention for Future

- Always use Netlify DNS for Netlify-hosted sites
- Avoid mixing DNS management between registrar and host
- Monitor DNS changes with propagation checking tools
- Keep DNSSEC disabled unless specifically needed

**Note**: This is an infrastructure issue, not a code issue. Your website code is perfect and ready to go. The problem is purely in the DNS/domain configuration between GoDaddy and Netlify.
